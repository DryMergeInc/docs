title: Overview
description: "We're constantly building templates that help reduce the time necessary to use our product. Many common use cases for building triggers, data syncs, or actions with existing services are already covered by DryMerge"

We think Drymerge is really powerful, and we know for a fact that it can represent more useful workflows in fewer lines of code with higher reliability than other workflow tools
We also know that code benefits from ecosystems and prebuilt components, so we're writing a lot of YAML to ship common, repeated use cases that you can use in your own workflows.

## Index of Prebuilt Triggers

Head over to the [triggers](/prebuilt-tools/triggers/page) page to see a list of all the prebuilt triggers we've written.
