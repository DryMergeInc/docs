title: "Imports & Templates"
description: "To reduce boilerplate and tap into the ecosystem, DryMerge supports importing external entities with modifications you'd like to make applied to them. Furthermore, DryMerge supports the definition of `templates`, which can either be imported or called via an API to programmatically generate entities without defining redundant YAML."

## Imports

Imports in DryMerge allow for the inclusion of pre-defined entities with the ability to modify or alias their attributes. The import mechanism enables DryMerge configurations to be more modular and reusable.

### Anatomy of an Import

An import object comprises several key fields:

- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the import.
- **`use`**: A mapping of entities to be imported and their desired aliases in the current configuration.
- **`but`**: (Optional) Modifications to apply to the imported entities.
- **`hydrate`**: (Optional) Values to fill into templates when importing them.
- **`replace`** (Optional) A string to string mapping of raw strings to replace in the imported entities.

### Example 1: Importing a Gmail Trigger Template

In this example, a Gmail trigger template is imported and hydrated with specific values.

```yaml
organization: DryMerge
version: 1
infra:
  our_trigger.import:
    use:
      # Note that when we import from a template, we can use _ to use the template's provided name instead of a new alias.
      customer-gmail-trigger.template: _
    hydrate:
      user_id: 'edward'
      refresh_token: 'MY_REFRESH_TOKEN'
      message: 'Edward received a new email!! Huge for us!'
```
### Example 2: Importing and Modifying an Existing API Node

In this example, we import an existing API node called `entrypoint.api` and modify its behavior by adding a sleep operation.

Initial node:
```yaml
  entrypoint.api:
    request:
      url: https://httpstat.us/200
      method: GET
    dependencies:
      xd:
        id: trigger-initial.api
```


Modified using an import:
```yaml
organization: DryMerge
version: 1
nodes:
  new_entrypoint.import:
    use:
      entrypoint.api: modified_entrypoint.api
    but:
      <modified_entrypoint.api>.request.url: https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=5000  # Add a sleep of 5 seconds before the request
```

In the modified version, we've imported the entrypoint.api node as modified_entrypoint.api and added a sleep of 5 seconds before the request is executed.

## Templates

Templates in DryMerge provide a reusable blueprint for defining entities. They allow for the specification of placeholders, which can be filled in at a later time, either during import or when calling a specific API. This ensures that repetitive configurations can be abstracted away into templates, allowing for more modular and maintainable DryMerge code.

### Anatomy of a Template

In DryMerge, a `Template` serves as a blueprint for defining entities with placeholders. These placeholders can be filled in at a later time, either during import or when calling a specific API endpoint, enabling a dynamic and flexible configuration.

Here's a breakdown of the primary components within a template:

- **`id`:** A unique identifier for the template. This typically follows the pattern `[organization]/[namespace]/[name].[type]:[version]`.

- **`content`:** The main body of the template, containing the entities and configurations it represents. This section can have placeholders, denoted by `{{template.placeholder_name}}`, which are expected to be provided values when the template is used.

- **`schemas`:** (Optional) This section can be used to define JSON schemas that validate the structure and content of provided data when the template is instantiated.

- **`defaults`:** (Optional) This section can be used to define default values for the template's placeholders.

- **`perms`:** (Optional) Permissions related to the node.

- **`metadata`:** (Optional) Additional metadata related to the entity.

For instance, in our earlier Gmail monitoring example:


Here's an example of a template:

```yaml
organization: DryMerge
version: 1
templates:
  # This template lays out all the entities needed to monitor a specific user's Gmail account and trigger an action when they receive a new email.
  customer-gmail-trigger.template:
    content:
      # This is the trigger for a specific user's Gmail account
      google/new-gmail-{{template.user_id}}.trigger:
        running: true
        check:
          hit:
            id: google/emails-{{template.user_id}}.api
          schedule: '{{template.schedule}}'
        conditions:
          if-new-email-received:
            - field: 'messages'
              diff:
                query: 'length(@) > `0`'
        then:
          hit:
            id: google/action-{{template.user_id}}.api
            with:
              message: '{{template.user_id}} received a new email!!'
  defaults:
    schedule: '1/5 * * * * *'
```

The placeholder `{{template.user_id}}` in the content section denotes a variable part of the configuration, which is expected to be provided a specific value when the template is instantiated. This allows the same template to be reused for monitoring different Gmail users by simply providing different user_id values during instantiation. We provide defaults for the schedule placeholder in the defaults section, which can be overridden when the template is instantiated. If `schedule` is not provided, it will hydrate as `1/5 * * * * *`.
