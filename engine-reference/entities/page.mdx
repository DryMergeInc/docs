## Names, Permissions, Transformations, and Maps
 Since we form a dependency graph that can only be modified and ran by specific people, we need a way to specify (1): names for objects and (2): permissions. We do this with the `"id"` and `"perms"` fields. Somet imes, we also need to apply common data transformations or to apply a node's logic to every element of an iterable. We do this with the `transform` and `map` fields. Occasionally, we want to handle an error popping up from an API or function call. We do this with the `error` field Let's look at each of these in detail.

### `id` Field

The `id` field serves as a unique identifier for each object within DryMerge. It follows a specific structure, formatted as `[organization]/[namespace]/[name].[type]:[version]`.

- **Organization**: Specifies the group or company that created the object. This is usually your own organization.
- **Namespace**: Provides a logical grouping for the object, often indicating its functional domain.
- **Name**: A self-explanatory, specific name for the object.
- **Type**: Indicates what type of object this is. The DryMerge engine recognizes these as one of `api`, `merge`, `state`, `route`, or `request`.
- **Version**: (Optional) A numerical identifier for the object's version. It is often omitted but can be used to refer to specific revisions of an object.

**Examples**:
- `drymerge/myApp/user.api`
- `drymerge/payments/transaction.route:1`

**A Note on Inference**:
Since identities can be lengthy to type out in full, DryMerge script also supports shorthand notation. You can specify your organization at the top level of your script, e.g. `organization: my-org`. Then, you can omit the organization from your `id` fields, e.g. `my-org/myApp/user.api` becomes `myApp/user.api`. We can further infer namespace: if we omit namespace in the script, we use the default namespace ~. So `myApp/user.api` would simply become `user.api`. It's fullname would be `my-org/~/user.api` (note the default namespace in place of `myApp`).
### `perms` Field

The `perms` field provides information related to permissions, which are crucial for access control.

### Permissions

Permissions in DryMerge are represented as the `perms` structure, a mapping between `Action` types and a list of `Condition` checks. This enables granular control over who can perform what action on a given object.

The `Action` types can be one of:
- `Create`: Permission to create a new instance of the object.
- `Read`: Permission to read or view the object.
- `Update`: Permission to modify the object.
- `Delete`: Permission to remove the object.
- `Execute`: Permission to execute actions related to the object.
- `Search`: Permission to search within the object.

The `Condition` checks can include:
- `UserIsCreator`: The user must be the creator of the object.
- `UserIsSameNamespace`: The user must belong to the same namespace as the object.
- `UserIsMemberOfOrganization`: The user must be a member of the organization that owns the object.
- `UserIsAdminOfOrganization`: The user must be an administrator of the organization that owns the object.
- `UserIsDrymergeAdmin`: The user must be an administrator of the DryMerge system.

**Example Permissions**:

```yaml
perms:
  map:
    Read:
      - UserIsCreator
      - UserIsAdminOfOrganization
    Update:
      - UserIsCreator
    Delete:
      - UserIsAdminOfOrganization
```
### Transformations

DryMerge supports transformations to manipulate JSON objects. These transformations are defined as a list in the `transform` field of DryMerge entities and can be applied to any JSON object. Here's a rundown of the different `transform` options.

#### `query` (JmespathTransformation)

The `query` transformation is powered by JMESPath, a query language for JSON. It allows you to extract and transform elements from a JSON document.

**Attributes**:
- **`expression`**: The JMESPath expression to apply.
- **`field`**: (Optional) Specifies a field within the input JSON to which the JMESPath expression should be applied. If omitted, the expression will be applied to the entire input.

**Example**:
```yaml
transform:
  - query:
      expression: 'locations[?state == 'WA'].name | sort(@) | {WashingtonCities: join(', ', @)}'
      field: data
```
#### `validate` (ValidateTransformation)

The `validate` transformation checks the input JSON against a specified JSON schema and ensures the data adheres to the expected format.

**Attributes**:
- **`schema`**: The JSON schema against which the input will be validated.
- **`field`**: (Optional) If specified, only this field from the input JSON will be validated against the schema.

**Example**:
```yaml
transform:
  - validate:
      field: user
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
        required:
          - name
```
#### `extract` (ExtractTransformation)

The `extract` transformation allows you to select a specific field from the input JSON, effectively filtering out other fields.

**Attributes**:
- **`field`**: Specifies the field to be extracted from the input JSON.

**Example**:
```yaml
transform:
  - extract:
      field: user.details
```
#### Order of Operations

Transformations are applied in the order they are listed. For example, if you first use an `extract` transformation to narrow down the input JSON and then apply a `query` transformation, the `query` will only be applied to the filtered JSON from the `extract` operation.

**Example**:
```yaml
transform:
  - extract:
      field: user
  - query:
      expression: 'details.age'
```

In the example above, the `query` transformation is only applied to the `user` field extracted in the previous step.


### Mapping Over Iterables with `map`

DryMerge provides functionality to iterate over elements of a collection, applying a specific node to each element. This iterative operation is defined using the `map` field available in every DryMerge node. By utilizing this feature, users cac map a DryMerge node over each item in an iterable, producing a new iterable with results.

#### Attributes of `map`

- **`field`**: Specifies the field in the context that contains the iterable. This field must be a collection, such as an array, over which the node will iterate.

#### Example of `map` in Action

Consider a scenario where you want to apply a transformation to each secret in a list. Here's how you'd structure your DryMerge configuration:

```yaml
aggregate.merge:
  merge:
    lmao:
      dry_string: '{{context.reflect}}'
  dependencies:
    reflect:
      id: reflect.merge
      args:
        all:
          - 'secret1'
          - 'secret2'
          - 'secret3'
reflect.merge:
  map:
    field: 'context.all'
  merge:
    secret:
      dry_string: 'Here is the secret! {{map}}'
```

In this example, the reflect.merge node maps over each secret provided in the context.all array. For each secret, the node processes it and appends the result to a new iterable. This makes it incredibly powerful for batch processing and transformations over collections.


## Error Handling

The `error` field allows you to define error handling strategies for your entities. You can retry your workflow, specify what other workflows actions to start based on different error statuses, and set a default error response.

**Attributes**:
- **`handle`**: A list of error handlers, where each handler is associated with a specific status or range of statuses.
    - **`status`**: The HTTP status or a range of statuses that this handler will catch. Ranges can be defined as `"200:299"` or a single status as `"404"`.
    - **`using`**: The action to take when the error is caught. This can be one of two types:
        - **`hit`**: Trigger another API or function.
        - **`retry`**: Retry the current operation after a specified delay.
    - **`delay`**: (Optional, only for `retry`) The delay in milliseconds before retrying the operation.
- **`default`**: A default message or action to take if none of the error handlers catch the error.
- **`attempts`**: (Optional) The maximum number of attempts for error handling. Defaults to 5.

**Example**:
```yaml
error:
  handle:
    - status: '500'
      using:
        retry:
          delay: 4000
    - status: '400:499'
      using:
        hit:
          id: some.api
  default: 'An unexpected error occurred'
  attempts: 3
```

In the example above, if a `500` status error occurs, the system will retry the operation after a 4-second delay. For client errors ranging from `400` to `499`, another API identified by `some.api` will be triggered. If none of the error handlers catch the error, a default message "An unexpected error occurred" will be returned, and the entire process will attempt a maximum of 3 times.

This powerful error handling mechanism ensures that your DryMerge workflows can gracefully handle errors and take appropriate actions, enhancing the robustness of your applications.
