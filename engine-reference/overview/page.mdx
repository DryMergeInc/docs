description: "DryMerge is a YAML-based configuration format used to define workflows. We focus on defining two things: the infrastructure used to kick off the workflow and the shape of the workflow itself. "

## Workflow Infrastructre 
We have two types of workflow infra: triggers and cronjobs. Triggers are used to kick off workflows based on events, such as a new row being added to a database or a new file being uploaded to a bucket. Cronjobs are used to kick off workflows at a regular interval, such as every 5 minutes or every day at 3pm.

## Workflow Shape
DryMerge workflows are defined as a dependency graph. Each node in the graph is a DryMerge entity, which can represent an API call, a function, or a data manipulation.  With a dependency graph, we're able to cleanly represent all sorts of common workflows.  


## What next?
We can walk you through the basics of how DryMerge config starting in the [next section](/language-reference/templating/page).
