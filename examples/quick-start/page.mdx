title: Examples of DryMerge Workflows
description: "DryMerge is a fairly complex engine. That complexity comes with expressive power, but it can be hard to absorb everything and get started. We've put together some examples of how you can use DryMerge to solve common problems. Oftentimes, it's sufficient to provide a few examples to an LLM and ask it to make yours with the others as a basis. Or, ask our docs to do it!"

As our list of examples grows, we'll try to put them into logical categories. For now, we've mixed them together under [this page](/examples/foundations/page).
