Once that's all done, you're ready to go!

## Hello World (In DryMerge)
Let's build a simple API that returns "Hello World" when you hit the endpoint. Then, we can add on to it to make it a little more interesting.

### Create a new file

In your current directory, create a new file with the `.yaml` extension. At the top, specify your organization:

 ```js
organization: DryMerge
 ```

### Add your first node :)
For now, let's make a simple node. We'll call it `hello-world` and it'll return "Hello World" when you hit the endpoint. There are three components we need to define for any API node: `id`, `request`, and `dependencies`. Let's think through them one by one.

#### Define a node
Nodes are defined within the `nodes` field, and given names and types with their id. The id is the key that defines how we refer to your API Node. The format is `[name].[type]`. We can do that for our node like this:

```yaml
nodes:
    hello-world.api:
        ...
```
Note that the `...` just indicates in the documentation that this is part of a bigger yaml object, it doesn't have any special meaning :)

#### Define the request schema
The request schema is a yaml object that defines HTTP requests that the node will make. Here, you can specify `body`, `url`, `headers`, `method`, or `params`. For example, a simple GET request to get the time could look like this:

```yaml
nodes:
    get-time.api:
        request:
            url: https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/San_Francisco
            method: GET
```

Our node wll be simple. There's this neat endpoint that we set up at `https://std.drymerge.com/testing/reflect`, and it just sends your request body back at you. With that knowledge, we can get it to send `Hello World!` to us! Try to begin defining the request schema core yourself, and see how well it matches the version we set up below:

```yaml
  ...
    request:
        url: https://std.drymerge.com/testing/reflect
        method: POST
        headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
        body:
            message: Hello World!
  ...
```

#### Define the dependency schema
The dependency schema is a yaml object that defines the dependencies of the node. This node doesn't need any dependencies, but let's show how we could check the time before calling it.

Here, we say to call the node with id `get-time.api` before we call our Hello World api. We've also aliased the response to `time`, which we could use to access any part of the response body.
```yaml
nodes:
    hello-world.api:
        request:
            ...
        dependencies:
            time:
                id: get-time.api
```

#### Put it all together
Now that we have all the components, we can put it all together into one big yaml file. It'll look like this:

```yaml
organization: DryMerge
version: 1
nodes:
  hello-world.api:
    request:
      url: https://std.drymerge.com/testing/reflect
      method: POST
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      body:
        dry_string:
          message: 'Hello World! (at {{context.time.body.datetime}})'
    dependencies:
      time:
        id: get-time.api
    get-time.api:
        request:
            url: https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/San_Francisco
            method: GET
```

Save this yaml file and keep track of the path.

### Upload your node

Now, we can upload our node to the DryMerge engine after which we can run it from anywhere. Simply use the `dry up` command like this:

```shell
dry up <path-to-your-yaml>
```

You should get a success message! If not, make sure that you're authenticated and that you've provided the right path to your yaml.
### Call your node
This is the whole point of a node, right? Let's call it! There are two ways to call your node: via the CLI or via the API.

### Call your node via the CLI
If you're using the CLI, you can use the `dry run` command to run your node like this:

```shell
dry run hello-world.api
```

### Call your node via the API
Both the CLI and browser make underlying calls to the DryMerge API. You can make one of these calls yourself if you want to! One way to do it is via curl, like this:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://drymerge.com/execute/<my-organization>/~/hello-world.api' \ 
```

### Other ways to call your node
You could call your node via an API testing tool like Postman or Insomnia or via a programming language like Python or Javascript. The possibilities are endless!
