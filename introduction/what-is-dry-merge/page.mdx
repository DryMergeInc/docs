title: Introduction to DryMerge
description: DryMerge is a workflow development toolkit designed to create event-driven integrations. Our infrastructure handles triggers, scheduling, monitoring, and concurrent execution. Connect this infrastructure to your codebase by running our client. Jobs can be run with your existing code written in any language or with an existing API. This allows external events to integrate with your software.

## How Does It Work?

DryMerge is like Terraform for your workflows, combining the power of declarative configuration with a robust orchestration engine. Here's how it simplifies your workflow:

### 1. Declarative Configuration with LLMs

- **What It Means**: Write a few lines of YAML to define your workflow.
- **Why It Matters**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can efficiently handle the writing, letting you focus on the high level idea of what you want to integrate.

### 2. Managed Runtime Engine for triggers, scheduling, and monitoring

- **What It Means**: DryMerge's engine deploys your YAML configuration and takes care of every aspect of maintaining production-level workflows.
- **Why It Matters**: You get enterprise-grade reliability and insights without the headache of building the infrastructure yourself.
