title: Introduction to DryMerge
description: DryMerge is a toolkit designed to create event-driven workflows. Our infrastructure handles triggers, scheduling, monitoring, and concurrent execution. You can connect this infrastructure to your codebase by running our client. Workflows can be composed with your existing code written in any language or with an existing API. We focus on linking external events and data directly to your software.

## How Does It Work?

DryMerge is like Terraform for your workflows, combining the power of declarative configuration with a robust orchestration engine. Here's what makes our engine special:

### 1. Declarative Configuration with LLMs

- **What It Means**: Write a few lines of YAML to define your workflow.
- **Why It Matters**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can efficiently handle the writing, letting you focus on the high level idea of what you want to do.

### 2. Managed Runtime Engine for Triggers, Scheduling, and Monitoring

- **What It Means**: DryMerge's engine deploys your YAML configuration and takes care of every aspect of maintaining production-level workflows.
- **Why It Matters**: You get enterprise-grade reliability and insights without the headache of building the infrastructure yourself.
